        <changelogtext>Note: There are BIG changes in this release!
            This release includes support for four major cloud storage providers:
            Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Box.
            Dropbox synchronization now can use a file anywhere in the file tree and is not limited to the app folder.
            Dropbox is deprecating API v1 and therefore you will need to reinitialize synchronization.
            Please test out and report any feedback either via email or on GitHub.
