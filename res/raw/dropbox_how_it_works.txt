First you need to login on Dropbox from Money Manager Ex for Android. 
If this is the first time you must give authorization for the application to access the folder /apps/Money Manager Mobile on Dropbox. If the folder does not exist, Dropbox creates. 
If you already use a database (file mmb) copy from PC in this folder, otherwise load your database with upload.
Link the database (file mmb) with the application. The first time will be downloaded automatically.
After linking the database, a service in background will verify the changes in the database.
